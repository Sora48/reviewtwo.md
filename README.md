i would give this game a 9 to 10 - 1 being the worse and 10 being the best 

Summary
  The binding of isaac is a bible story about a mom trying  to kill her son to prove her love to god over all, before Issac  is about to be killed he slips into this demension. In the demension he encounters all sorts of enemies trying to stop him from successfully going back to defeat his mother. 
  It is hard to say anything bad about Binding of Issac. The games has hours and hours of replay vaule, the games has diffculty settings, the games has different bible characters you can unlock after beating the game, the game has more than 100 items and powers you can unlock, the games has a challenge mode and that just the regular game ( THEY JUST ADDED DLC!!!!) with even more content. 
  The game play is simple its a top down shooter pretty much. In Binding of Issac you are trying to collect powerups and stay alive while fighting enemies and mini bosses to proceed to the next level until you get to your mother or the final boss . The powers are really unique because you have different types, from offense and defense buffs, to offense and defense debuffs, and to overpowermoves. 
  The enemies are unique in the since most if not all are related to the bible like gluttony, famine and more . What make this game good is that it is not a simple game because of the pattern of each enemy is different. All depending on what power ups you find in the beginning of the game can make you lose early or help destory the enemies.
  The only thing that is a bothersome which is not a big deal is that i wished it was just as much story as power ups, now dont get me wrong it is enough to do but you will understand when you play it.
  The replayability is insane  because you can literally play each character 11 different times and still have stuff to unlock. All depending on if you play on a certain diffculty, choose heaven or hell, or what character you unlock. Now that just the game alone, Binding of Issac also has challenge modes that you unlock by beating the game. In the challenge some start you off with a great set of powerups and some dont.
  The soundtrack is good simple back ground noises for and old school dungeon type game .
  If you are here for graphic then this not your game. It is a indie game that is perfect the way it is.

Final Thoughts
Binding of Issac should be a game that every game should try. It is one of those addicting game that you just cant get enough off. The different with Binding of Issac addiction is that you are always finding a new item, new powerup, and unlocking more challenges along the way. The bosses or unique and could be diffcult all depending on the boss. The game is no push over which helps the average gamer or new gamer test their skills along with enjoying the game. One thing which is not a huge setback it is not long but i think the game is built for te replay vaule which ii has knock it out of the park i mean full homerun. I would suggest anybody to play the game if you are looking for a challenge and if you love games
